# Cat Classifier
This is a **logistic regression implementation** with **neural networks** as a part of learning **Deep Learning Specialization** with **Andrew Ng**. 
Here we will build a classifier to recognize cats.

## Problem Statement
In this problem we have been given a dataset("data.h5") which contains:

- Training Set of **m_train** images and they have been labeled as cat or non-cat with their **y** values being either 1 or 0 respectively.

- Similarly for test set we have **m_test** images labeled as cat ot non-cat.

- Dimension of each image is **num_px * num_px * 3** where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB)

I have to build a simple image recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
